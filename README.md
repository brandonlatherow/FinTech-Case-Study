* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    - Cashapp currently uses a combination of both fraud detection and encryption technologies (Wikipedia).
    - "Cloud encryption key management services such as AWS KMS make encrypting data easy and safe." AWS KMS stands for Amazon Web Services Key Management Services, which is a technology commonlny used by other companies in the fintech field as well. 
    - Cashapp is able to minimize the amount of time an attacker may have access to data, since through KMS, data is encrypted and decrypted on demand. 
    - Cashapp utilizes a concept called Envelope Encryption, creating a "unique single-use encryption key for each encrytion operation, and encrypt the data locally using that data key."  (Cash App Code Blog)
## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    - The biggest innovation in the past ten years in the mobile p2p payment industry was the introduction of social network mobile transfers - started by Venmo in 2011, and later followed by services like Cashapp and Zelle.

(Sisko, 2020)
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    - Zelle
    - Paypal
    - Venmo
    - Apple Pay
    - Samsung Pay
    - WorldRemit


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    - Cashapp has had an impact on the consumer mostly through creating a more competitive environment between mobile p2p payment services, increasing the speed of improvements for their services and benefitting the consumer. When looking at block, Inc. as a whole, the creation of Square can be seen as the biggest individual business impact the company has made. Founded in 2009, Square was the first popularized service to give small businesses the capability of accepting credit card payments.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    - One measure of success for companies in the p2p payment domain is their yearly # of users. In 2021 cashapp had 29.3% of the yearly users, which is actually less than both Venmo and Zelle.
    - One aspect that Cashapp is doing well in, is cryptocurrency. By the end of 2020, a large portionn of its revenues came from Bitcoin services. This portrays Cashapp's likely future growht, considering cryptocurrency usage is still steadily increasing. (Kats, 2021)


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - Cash app does not seem to be doing as well as its competitors when it comes to the social aspect. Venmo, for example, nearly feels like a social media app. One way that Cashapp could easily get ahead, would be by adding the ability to follow other users and like payments.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    - It would mostly benefit the company by making the app more fun and interactive between friends, no longer confining itself as simply an app for sending and recieving payments. It would also increase the appeal to younger audiences.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    - One technology that is common in social media apps is Augmented Reality (AR). This may be pushing it, but adding features that social media apps have, like sending photos/videos with AR (face filters for example) along with your payment, could be a good future idea.
